                            Sass was difficult to get running. Didn't realize you needed to use commands in the console.
                            Once I got it up and running however it worked really well, I love that you can define variables.
                            I didn't really play around with mixins since I didn't find anything to use them on.
                            The only thing I can think of that would keep me from using Sass compared to regular CSS is the console part,
                            otherwise I find SCSS to be far superior with the tiny experience I have with it.
