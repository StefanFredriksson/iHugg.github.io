                    <p>
                        Sass was difficult to get running. Didn't realize you needed to use commands in the console.<br>
                        Once I got it up and running however it worked really well, I love that you can define variables.<br>
                        I didn't really play around with mixins since I didn't find anything to use them on.<br>
                        The only thing I can think of that would keep me from using Sass compared to regular CSS is the console part.<br>
                        Otherwise I find SCSS to be far superior with the tiny experience I have with it.<br>
